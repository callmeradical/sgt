// handleRunResume is authoritative. A dashboard holding its own list of resumable
// statuses would be a second authority for one rule, and the two would drift into
// offering an action the server rejects. Resumable is derived here from the same
// ResumableStatuses that endpoint enforces, so there is exactly one list.
