// started; that is sound only if there is exactly one coordinator. A second
// instance opening the same store would reconcile a live run out from under
// it — silently, with no error, and (once it died on the port-bind conflict
// that followed) with no surviving trace (progress.html Review 034).

// SGT_UI_LOCK overrides the path so tests never contend with, or wait
// behind, a real running instance's lock.
