## Progress reporting

A checklist has been seeded into .sgt/plan.json in your working directory.
It contains one item per declared scenario for this change, each with:
  - "id":       a stable identifier — do not change it
  - "scenario": the scenario text — do not change it
  - "status":   one of "pending", "in_progress", or "complete"

As you work, update the file to reflect your progress:
1. Before starting an item, set its "status" to "in_progress".
2. When the item is done (test written and passing), set it to "complete".
3. Only one item should be "in_progress" at a time.

Example update for a single item:
  {"id": "s-1", "scenario": "The checklist has one item per scenario", "status": "complete"}

Read the file first, update the relevant item, and write the whole file back.
Do not change any other field. Do not add or remove items.
