// The ordered change sequence. Decision D10 adopts AHP's subscribe/snapshot/
// replay model, which treats reconnection as a protocol concern rather than
// leaving every client to re-read the world on a timer.
//
// Two properties carry the whole design and both are enforced by the schema
// rather than by application code:
//
//   - seq INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT is strictly increasing, so a replay
//     ordered by seq is the order in which the transitions happened;
//   - AUTOINCREMENT never reuses a value after a delete, so a pruned history
//     cannot make two different transitions share a sequence number and leave
//     replay ambiguous.
//
// The table is append-only. Nothing in this package updates or deletes a row.

// Channels partition the sequence by the kind of thing that moved, so a client
// can decide what to re-render without decoding every payload.
//
// run, intent and bullet are the domain transitions. phase and envelope are
// included because both already mutate what an operator sees — RecordPhase bumps
// runs.updated_at, and an envelope is what the activity view renders — and a
// client that could not see them would still need a timer to notice them.
