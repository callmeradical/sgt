// nothing that needs quoting in a shell, a path or a git refname.
//
// The form is sgt-<unix seconds>-<hex>. The epoch is kept because it lets an
// operator read roughly when a run started straight off the id. The suffix is
// what the previous format lacked: fmt.Sprintf("sgt-%d", time.Now().Unix()) gave
// two dispatches in the same second the same id, so the second collided on the
// runs primary key and looked deduplicated when nothing had deduplicated it.
// Deliberate deduplication is the caller's request_id; an id only has to be
// unique.
//
// A run id is not a speech label. Use Slug for anything an operator has to read
// aloud.

		// pool, and the counter below still separates same-process calls.
