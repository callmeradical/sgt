# Skill: sgt-help

Answer Sgt installation, setup, usage, skills, and troubleshooting questions
from repository-owned documentation.

## When to use

Load this skill when the user asks what Sgt is, how to install/configure/use
it, where skills come from, how to run a command/workflow, or how to diagnose a
Sgt error.

Do not load it as a substitute for `load-project`, `cross-repo-work`, `dispatch`,
or `wiki` after the user has requested execution of those procedures.

## Documentation map

| Question | Primary document |
|---|---|
| Any general question about installing, configuring, or using Sgt | `internal/manual/manual.md` — via `sgt help [topic]` or `GET /api/manual`; check this first |
| Product and deployment model | `docs/architecture.md` |
| Installation and first project | Not yet written for v2 — see `README.md`'s Quick start and `AGENTS.md`'s "Two ways in" section for the closest available guidance |
| External and bundled skill sources | `docs/repo-scoped-skills.md` |
| Direct/dispatch workflows and commands | `skills/dispatch/SKILL.md`, `skills/cross-repo-work/SKILL.md` |
| Errors, stale runs, auth, gates, cleanup | `docs/troubleshooting.md` |
| Project YAML fields | `docs/schema.md` |
| The v2 HTTP API and MCP tool reference | `skills/dispatch/SKILL.md` |
| Agent execution policy | `AGENTS.md` |

v1's docs describing the removed `bin/sgt-*` toolbelt (`what-is-sgt.md`,
`getting-started.md`, `skills.md`, `using-sgt.md`) were archived to
`docs/archive/v1/` — do not cite them as current guidance.

v2's command reference is `POST /api/*` routes (`internal/ui/server.go`) and MCP
tools (`internal/mcp/server.go`'s `Tools()`), not `bin/sgt-*` — there is no shell
toolbelt to consult on this branch.

## Query procedure

1. Classify the question against the documentation map.
2. Read the primary document before searching broadly.
3. For terms not resolved there, search repository documentation and Sgt
   skills:

   ```bash
   rg -n -i --glob '*.md' -- '<term>' README.md docs skills
   ```

4. When the configured Sgt graph exists and the question is architectural,
   use the `sgt_graph_query` MCP tool or `POST /api/build-graph` output and
   cite source locations.
5. For flag or argument questions about the `sgt` CLI, run `--help` only when the command supports it —
   today none of `sgt`'s subcommands do, so inspect its emitted usage/error contract and command tests
   instead. For the HTTP API and MCP tools there is no `--help` at all — the reference is the route/body-field
   table in `skills/dispatch/SKILL.md`.
6. Answer with the exact command, required preconditions, expected evidence, and
   links to repository-relative documentation paths.
7. If sources disagree, use this precedence:
   - route/handler behavior and its tests (`internal/ui/server_test.go` and
     friends) for released syntax;
   - `AGENTS.md` for always-on execution/safety policy;
   - trigger-loaded skill for its procedure;
   - `docs/schema.md` for project fields;
   - user documentation for walkthroughs.
8. State when a behavior is undocumented or contradictory. Do not invent a
   command, flag, state transition, or safety guarantee.

## Help response format

```text
Answer: <direct answer>
Command: <exact command, when applicable>
Requires: <preconditions>
Verify: <observable success evidence>
Docs: <repository-relative links>
```

Omit fields that do not apply. Keep destructive operations out of examples unless
the documentation requires confirmation and the user explicitly requested them.

## Failure behavior

| Condition | Required action |
|---|---|
| Primary document missing | Report its expected path and stop before guessing. |
| Command differs from docs | Report the mismatch and trust tested released behavior over documentation; create or suggest a documentation task. |
| Question requires project ownership | Load `load-project` and resolve project-details. |
| Question requires implementation or fleet mutation | Hand off to the owning procedural skill; help remains read-only. |
