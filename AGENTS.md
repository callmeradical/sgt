# Sgt v2

This branch is **v2**: the Go-native engine in `cmd/sgt` and `internal/`.
Read `docs/prd-sgt.md` before changing behaviour. Its numbered
requirements (R2.x, R3.x, R4.x) and settled decisions (D1–D7, O1–O3) are binding.

## v1 is not a dependency

The `bin/sgt-*` shell toolbelt is **v1**. On this branch:

- Do **not** call `sgt-dispatch`, `sgt-watch`, `sgt-respond`, `sgt-validate`,
  `sgt-context`, or any other `bin/sgt-*` script.
- Do **not** use tmux to run or supervise work.
- Do **not** write into v1's fleet layout at `~/.local/share/sergeant/fleet`.
- Where v1 has a capability v2 lacks (file-based intent artifacts,
  independent review workers, the shipping gate), that is **unimplemented v2
  scope**. Do not close the gap by shelling out to v1. v2 does track a
  canonical intent — see Domain model, below — just as a durable store row,
  never a file.

v1's instructions and its `bin/sgt-*` toolbelt live only on the original
project's `main` branch; this repository's history starts from v2 and contains
none of it.

## Domain model

```
Project            a named set of repositories
  └─ Intent        a durable statement of desired change; may span repos
       └─ Bullet   ONE repo, a vertical slice through that repo's stack,
                   implemented test-first, yielding one commit and one PR
```

Intent is the primary durable object. Runs, phases and worktrees exist to serve an
intent. A bullet is scoped to exactly one repository; work in a second repository
is a second bullet. The intent holds the merge order across its bullets.

Every phase for a bullet renders its prompt from the same canonical intent revision via `Store.RenderIntentBrief(intentID, repo, gates)` — never a stale or hand-copied restatement. v2 has no `.sgt-intent.md` or other worktree file carrying this; the intent's only durable form is the row in `store.Store`, addressed by `intentID`.

## Two ways in, one set of records

1. **Agent-driven.** The operator launches their own agent CLI (opencode, codex,
   goose, pi, claude) in a terminal inside the project. That agent talks to
   sgt over MCP — `sgt mcp` (a subcommand of the `sgt` binary,
   declared in `mcp.json` as `{"command": "./bin/sgt", "args": ["mcp"]}`;
   there is no separate `sgt-mcp` executable):
   `sgt_get_brief`, `sgt_run_gates`, `sgt_emit_envelope`,
   `sgt_seal_pr`, `sgt_status`, `sgt_run_status`,
   `sgt_run_wait`, `sgt_graph_query`, `sgt_graph_explain`,
   `sgt_graph_affected`. Sgt does not spawn or host the session.
2. **Coordinator-driven.** The operator dispatches from the UI
   (`POST /api/dispatch`) and sgt runs bounded headless agent phases itself.

Both create the same records. Adding a third, divergent execution model is a bug.

## Procedural skills

Load procedures only when their trigger applies:

| Trigger | Skill | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| A project is named, registered, edited, synced, or graphed, or repository ownership isn't already established | `load-project` | Registry lookup, schema, context loading, project edits |
| More than one repository owns the requested outcome | `cross-repo-work` | Repository decomposition, dependency and merge order, per-repo acceptance |
| A task spans multiple repos and should run as parallel dispatched subagents | `dispatch` | `POST /api/dispatch`, worktree isolation, monitoring |
| The user asks to ingest, backfill, regenerate, inspect, update, or change wiki output | `wiki` | Capture behavior, digest generation, schema ownership, index updates |
| The user asks what Sgt is, how to install/configure/use it, where skills come from, or how to diagnose an error | `sgt-help` | Documentation lookup, command verification, help responses |

Sgt-owned procedural skills live at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in this
repository. General software-engineering skills (not Sgt-specific) live
at `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and are discovered from that canonical
tree by Codex, OpenCode, and Claude.

For every listed trigger, read that repository-local file directly; it is canonical and takes precedence over any same-named registry skill. A harness registry may assist loading but its omission does not make the skill unavailable. Do not ask the owner or stop solely because the registry omits the skill. Only stop and report the exact repository-local path when that file is absent or unreadable; do not reconstruct a partial protocol from memory.

## Rules that are enforced in code

Do not weaken these. Each has a test.

| Rule | Where |
|---|---|
| Agents run in an isolated git worktree on a per-run branch; a non-git dir is refused | `internal/dag/engine.go` |
| The operator's checkout is never mutated | `TestRunStageIsolatesWorkInAWorktree` |
| Agent output is committed so it survives worktree cleanup | `TestCommitRunOutputMakesWorkRecoverable` |
| Code gates run in sorted name order | `TestGatesRunInDeterministicOrder` |
| A failed or timed-out agent phase records `failed`, never `passed` | `TestAgentPhaseFailureIsNotRecordedAsPassed` |
| Each retry attempt gets its own phase record | `TestAgentPhaseRetriesAreObservable` |
| Saving project config preserves comments, `dag:`, and unmodelled keys | `TestRefineProjectPreservesUnmanagedConfig` |
| Delivery reports never claim a PR that git cannot prove | `internal/ui/server.go` `describeDelivery` |
| A dispatch resolves to an OpenSpec change before any run row or worktree exists | `TestDispatchWithUnknownChangeIDIsRejectedAndCreatesNoRun` |

## Truthfulness

The dashboard is what an operator checks instead of reading logs, so it must not
display anything it cannot derive from stored state.

- Never render a status, count, duration, or progress value that is not read from
  the store.
- When data is absent, render an em dash and say what is missing.
- Never claim delivery, a pull request, or a passing gate without evidence on disk.
- `_ = json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(...)` is banned. Use `writeJSON`, which marshals
  before writing a header so a failure becomes a 500 instead of an empty 200.

## Build and test

```bash
go build ./...
go vet ./internal/...
go test ./internal/... -count=1
```

The UI is embedded with `//go:embed static/*`, so changing
`internal/ui/static/index.html` requires a rebuild before it is served.

Environment:

- `SGT_AGENT_TIMEOUT` — per-attempt agent budget (default 10m)
- `SGT_GATE_TIMEOUT` — per-gate budget (default 5m)
- `SGT_FLEET_DIR` — worktree root; set in tests so they never touch the real path
- `SGT_CONFIG` — project YAML directory

## Planning: OpenSpec

OpenSpec is a first-class planning method (O1–O3). Planning lives per repository in
`openspec/`. A change's directory travels in the pull request that implements it —
that is what produces the audit trail. Do not adopt OpenSpec Stores.

Branches are named `<type>/<change-id>` where the suffix is the OpenSpec change id.
The audit link is the `openspec/changes/<id>/` directory in the PR diff, with a
`Change-Id: <id>` trailer as the secondary link. A branch name is never the audit
link on its own.

## Task tracking

Work is tracked with GitHub issues and pull requests on this repository.
`td` was only used to bootstrap the v2 rewrite and is not part of this
project's workflow; do not run `td` or `sgt-td-*` commands here, and do not
depend on an epic id resolving in a local `td` database.
