# an-intent-ships-through-a-shipping-gate

Once every bullet in an intent is sealed (or merged), an optional,
project-configured shipping gate runs across the intent as a whole; a pass
is recorded on the intent, a failure is recorded with a reason and holds
nothing back but the "ready" signal — no individual bullet's sealed status
changes, and Sgt still never merges anything itself.
